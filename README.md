# 📦 Review Rating Prediction

This project builds a predictive model to estimate user ratings based on the semantic and emotional content of e-commerce reviews. Each review is represented by a 64-dimensional embedding that captures its emotion-semantic meaning. The goal is to train a model that generalizes well across diverse review data to predict ratings accurately.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Uses pre-computed emotion-semantic embeddings as input
- Supports regression or classification-based rating prediction
- Lightweight, reproducible, and easy to adapt to other review datasets

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains 64-dimensional embeddings for user reviews, extracted from multiple e-commerce sources. Each embedding is paired with a corresponding user rating (e.g., 1 to 5 stars).
